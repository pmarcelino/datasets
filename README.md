# Datasets

This repository contains the datasets used in two MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) created by me. The MOOCs are titled "[Machine Learning, Maths & Ethics: Hands-on](https://courses.elearning.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/courses/course-v1:MOOCs+lematecX+2021/about)" and "[Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.lamaa.org/machine-learning)". The datasets are carefully selected to cover a wide range of machine learning tasks and scenarios, enabling learners to gain hands-on experience with real-world data. All datasets are provided in CSV format.
